        53:R:M >> Google about this shit, not just remenber. You have configured for Route 53 and wish to configure failover options for your webservers.  What is the sequence of events when failover happens? ANSWER:  Route 53 conducts a health check of your application. If your application fails 4 consecutive health checks as an example, it triggers the next event. Route 53 will disable the resource record for the failed endpoint and no longer serves these records. The failover step ensures that traffic gets routed to health endpoints instead of the failed one.
