# Identity Access Management (IAM)

## Policy 

You can use the IAM Policy Simulator to test and validate the effects 
of your IAM access control policies.

## Remember 

Max number of IAM roles, can be created per AWS Account = 250

 MFA-protected API access cannot work for federated users.
 
 
 You can specify a session limit between 15 minutes and 36 hours 
 (for GetFederationToken and GetSessionToken) and between 15 minutes 
 and 12 hours (for AssumeRole* APIs) for federated users to have access to the console.
 
## Hard part

You can configure your SAML 2.0-compliant IdP such as Active Directory 
to permit your federated users to access the AWS Management Console.
