# Identity Access Management (IAM)

## Policy 

You can use the IAM Policy Simulator to test and validate the effects 
of your IAM access control policies.

## NAT 

A NAT gateway supports bursts of up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth. 
If you require more than 10 Gbps bursts, you can distribute the 
workload by splitting your resources into multiple subnets, and 
creating a NAT gateway in each subnet.
