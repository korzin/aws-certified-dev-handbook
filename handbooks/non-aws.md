#### DMZ
  
DMZ(or demilitarized zone) is a physical or logical subnetwork that 
contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to 
an untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, originally Redundant 
Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a data storage virtualization
technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components
into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy,
performance improvement, or both.

A/B testing (bucket tests or split-run testing) 
is a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. 
It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or 
"two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. 
A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable,
typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against
variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more 
effective.
  
Input/output operations per second (IOPS, pronounced eye-ops) is an input/output performance measurement
 used to characterize computer storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD),
  and storage area networks (SAN). 
  

**RPO: Recovery Point Objective**

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) describes the interval of time that might pass during
 a disruption before the quantity of data lost during that period exceeds the Business
  Continuity Plan’s maximum allowable threshold or “tolerance.”

Example: If the last available good copy of data upon an outage is from 18 hours ago,
 and the RPO for this business is 20 hours then we are still within the parameters of 
 the Business Continuity Plan’s RPO. In other words it the answers the question – 
 “Up to what point in time could the Business Process’s recovery proceed tolerably given 
 the volume of data lost during that interval?”

**RTO: Recovery Time Objective**

The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the duration of time and a service level within which 
a business process must be restored after a disaster in order to avoid unacceptable consequences
 associated with a break in continuity. In other words, the RTO is the answer to the question: 
 “How much time did it take to recover after notification of business process disruption?“

RPO designates the variable amount of data that will be lost or will have to be re-entered during
 network downtime. RTO designates the amount of “real time” that can pass before the disruption
  begins to seriously and unacceptably impede the flow of normal business operations.

There is always a gap between the actuals (RTA/RPA) and objectives introduced by various manual 
and automated steps to bring the business application up. These actuals can only be exposed by 
disaster and business disruption rehearsals.
