# Elastic Load Balancer 

Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application or network traffic across 
multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, 
in multiple Availability Zones.

A load balancer distributes workloads across multiple compute resources, such as virtual servers.
 Using a load balancer increases the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.
