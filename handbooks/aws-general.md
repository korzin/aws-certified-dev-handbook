# AWS General information

## Global infrastructure

## Networking 

Amazon reserves the first four (4) IP addresses and the last one (1) IP
 address of every subnet for IP networking purposes.
 
 You can set up a VPC with a Private Subnet only and a Hardware VPN 
 Access to deploy a Site to Site link with the cloud. All instances in 
 the cloud can be configured with
  a route table to send traffic to the corporate DC in London.
  
You need to open port UDP 4500 to setup a VPN with a CGW behind a firewall or router.

Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data when occasional
 urgent requests for a subset of archives are required and data 
accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1 â€“ 5 minutes.
