#S3


If you enable Versioning with MFA Delete on your Amazon S3 bucket, 
two forms of authentication are required to permanently delete a version
 of an object: your AWS account credentials and a valid six-digit code 
 and serial number from an authentication device in your physical possession.
 
 
Amazon AWS locks down unauthorized access. Just because the original version permitted access
 does not mean future versions will; you must explicitly enable access to each version 
 you upload, either via the console or programmatically.
